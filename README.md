# Climate Analysis of Hawaii 

## Objective 

To obtain weather data for Hawaii to be able to set up a dashboard that can display filtered data.

## Purpose

To be able to create a dashboard that can connect directly to a database to retrieve filtered information.  

Using Jupyter Notebook, connect to database and do data analysis to gain intelligence from the data.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sqlite

## Modules Used

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Datetime
- SqlAlchemy
- Flask

## Conclusion

**Anaylis of Hawaii Data**
- The data suggests that majority of precipitation occurs from March to September whichs suggest this might been the rainy season for Hawaii. The precipitation graph shows that there is a major spike in March strecting to September. Then in months between there is a lower level of precipitation.

- The temperature range for Hawaii seems to be between 70 and 80 degrees which has the most frequencies of occurring according to the Station Analysis chart. So majority of the temperature ranges are in that range for the whole year from 08-24-16 to 08-23-17.

- For our trip data from 01-01-2017 to 03-01-2017 shows that the we are within the temperature range of what is implied by the Station Analysis chart. Our trip analysis chart show the average tempearture for the two months is within the 70-80 degrees range. The precipitation within those dates does not show any correlation depending on the lat, lng, or elevation on precipitation amounts because there isn't a clear trend show by precipitation function.
